# ===============================
# 📦 Requirements for Flowchart-to-English App
# ===============================

# 🌐 Web App Frameworks
streamlit                 # UI interface for uploading images and viewing output
fastapi                   # Backend API for image parsing
uvicorn[standard]         # ASGI server to serve FastAPI app

# 🔁 Communication and File Upload
requests                  # For Streamlit-to-FastAPI HTTP calls
python-multipart          # Enables file uploads in FastAPI

# 🖼 Image Processing
pillow                    # PIL image handling
opencv-python-headless    # OpenCV without GUI dependencies
numpy                     # Core image array operations

# 🔍 OCR & Text Processing
easyocr                   # GPU-capable OCR engine
textblob                 # Optional: lightweight text post-processing (optional)

# 🤖 Object Detection and Language Models
ultralytics               # YOLOv8/v9 detection (loads .pt models)
torch                     # Backend for YOLO and EasyOCR
transformers              # Optional: used for text summarization (LLMs)

# 📐 Geometry Utilities
shapely                   # Geometry operations for arrow-head box logic

# ✅ Optional Debug Tools (Uncomment if needed)
# matplotlib              # For plotting / bounding box debug

accelerate                #needed for LLM GPU Acceleration
